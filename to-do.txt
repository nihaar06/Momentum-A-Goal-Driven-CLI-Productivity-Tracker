provide a to-do list for the project\



Show thinking
Of course. Here is a structured to-do list to guide you through building the Momentum project from start to finish.

âœ… Project To-Do List: Momentum
Phase 0: Setup and Foundation
[ ] Supabase Setup:

[ ] Create a new project on the Supabase dashboard.

[ ] Use the SQL Editor to create the initial tables: goals and time_entries.

[ ] Copy your project's URL and anon key.

[ ] Local Project Setup:

[ ] Create a main project folder (e.g., momentum_cli).

[ ] Set up a Python virtual environment.

[ ] Install initial dependencies: pip install supabase python-dotenv.

[ ] Create your file structure: momentum.py, db.py, .env.

[ ] Add your Supabase credentials to the .env file.

Phase 1: MVP - The Goal-Driven Manual Tracker
[ ] Build the CLI Structure (momentum.py):

[ ] Set up argparse to handle the main commands: goal, start, stop, progress.

[ ] Create subparsers for the goal command: add and list.

[ ] Implement Database Logic (db.py):

[ ] Write a function to initialize the Supabase client.

[ ] Create functions: add_goal, list_goals, add_time_entry, and update_goal_progress.

[ ] Implement Core Timer Logic (momentum.py):

[ ] Write the start command to save the current state (goal_id, start_time) to a local JSON file.

[ ] Write the stop command to read the state file, calculate the duration, update Supabase via db.py, and delete the file.

[ ] Create the Progress View:

[ ] Implement the progress command to fetch goal data and display it.

[ ] Add a simple text-based progress bar for motivation.

[ ] Initial Testing:

[ ] Manually run each command to ensure goals can be created, started, stopped, and progress is updated correctly.

Phase 2: The Upgrade - Automatic Auditing
[ ] Enhance the Setup:

[ ] Install new dependencies: pip install pygetwindow pynput.

[ ] Update the Supabase schema in the SQL Editor: add the activity_logs and rules tables.

[ ] Build the Background Daemon (auto_tracker.py):

[ ] Create a new script for the background process.

[ ] Implement active window detection using pygetwindow.

[ ] Add logic to detect idle/AFK time using pynput.

[ ] Write the main loop to log activity data to the activity_logs table.

[ ] Add New CLI Commands (momentum.py):

[ ] Implement auto-start and auto-stop commands to manage the daemon process.

[ ] Implement rule add and rule list commands to manage the categorization rules.

[ ] Create the Automatic Report:

[ ] Implement the report --auto command to display a summary of data from the activity_logs table.

Phase 3: Final Touches
[ ] Error Handling: Add checks for common errors (e.g., trying to stop a timer when none is running, invalid goal ID).

[ ] Documentation: Create a README.md file with clear installation and usage instructions for all commands.

[ ] Code Refactoring: Clean up your code, add comments, and ensure it's easy to read.

[ ] (Optional) Packaging: Use a tool like PyInstaller to package your script into a standalone executable for easy distribution.
